# Exp-1 ATM & BANKING SYSTEM

# AIM:

To draw the UML diagram for ATM and Banking System.


# SRS (Procedure):

Step 1: Problem Identification
The main problem is the need for a fast, secure, and automated system that allows customers to perform banking transactions (like withdrawal, deposit, and fund transfer) without depending on bank staff.

Step 2: Requirement Analysis
Identify user needs (customer, admin, staff).
Define functional requirements: login, balance check, withdrawal, deposit, transfer, PIN change.
Define non-functional requirements: speed, security, reliability, and usability.

Step 3: System Design
Draw UML diagrams to represent the system:
Use Case Diagram
Class Diagram
Activity Diagram
Sequence Diagram
Communication Diagram
Package Diagram
Design the database with tables for Customer, Account, and Transaction.
